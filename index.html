		  <p>At Dever, community and family are cornerstones of what makes our school so special. The faculty and staff, along with the administration, are intensely committed to working together with parents and caregivers, and the greater Valley Stream Thirteen community, to provide the children with nothing but the best we have to offer.The first thing that strikes you when you come to Dever is that our school is a happy place. You are greeted with a smile and everyone is ready and willing to lend a helping hand. The faculty and staff are intensely collegial, and each works diligently to foster this sense of community. Additionally, they take very personally the task at hand – to ensure that each and every child develops to their fullest potential; academically, socially, and emotionally. Ask any child, and they will tell you that they love their school, and more importantly, that they are excited and love to come to school. It is here that they find a challenging and nurturing environment in which to test their abilities, make explorations and discoveries, construct meaning, and to make achievements that they can be proud of and celebrate. Ask any parent, and they will tell you that Dever provides opportunities for everyone to participate in and to be a part of this special learning community. Our extremely active parents work cooperatively with the school to enrich our children’s educational experience, both during and after school. We encourage citizenship and courtesy, along with caring and sharing. That’s what makes our school so special. Together we work to monitor and further our progress toward extremely high, but realistic standards, seek out novel and creative ways to improve our instructional endeavors, and to constantly strive for excellence. That’s what makes Dever so special.

   <h1>VALLEY STREAM PAYS TRIBUTE
TO 9/11 HEROES</h1>
    <p>
   This past September, the Valley Stream UFSD 13 paid respects to
those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. With the recently
passed state law enacted by Governor Cuomo requiring New York
schools to observe the 9/11 anniversary, the Valley Stream UFSD
13 showed its support by incorporating dialogue and education
among a new generation of students who were not alive during the
attacks. At Willow Road Elementary School, Mrs. Lepe’s fourth
grade class participated in a paired read of Fireboat and Saved by
the Boats. The students discussed the heroic acts of many during
a tragic time in our country’s history. To honor the brave men
and women who continue to serve our country, students crafted
heart-felt thank you letters.
Howell Road Elementary School paid tribute by having a moment of silence outside along with a few
words to remember and respect the national tragedy. Wheeler Avenue School and James A. Dever
Elementary School both had touching words said by students, teachers and staff. Officers from the
Nassau County Police Department also stopped by to help pay tribute.

       WILLOW EMBRACES RESPONSIVE
CLASSROOM APPROACH
       </h1>
       <p>
       Students in Nanci Brochhagen’s third
grade class at Willow Road Elementary
School started the year by building a
positive classroom community through
the Responsive Classroom Approach.
Responsive Classrooms are built on the
belief that integrating academic and socialemotional skills creates an environment
where students can do their best work.
A professional development workshop,
offered over the summer, provided teaching
practices and strategies to create a safe,
joyful and inclusive class
